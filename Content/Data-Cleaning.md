# Data-Cleaning

## Raw Data
- Responses are parsed to extract only relevant fields (e.g., repository name, stars, commit details).

## Validation
- Fields are checked for missing or null data (e.g., repositories without `README.md`).

## Formatting
- Extracted data can be converted into structured formats (e.g., JSON).
